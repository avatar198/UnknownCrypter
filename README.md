# UnknownCrypter
This project is not for usage (well at least not for you, i will use it lol), but to give you an idea how to write a FUD crypter in C#.

If you really want to use it, you'll need to code a few things:
-a decryptor
-a packer (not necessary but i suggest)
Watch out, its semi-polymorphic, so you'll need to scratch your head hard to write decrypter for this one :D 
Leave a star if it is useful for you.
